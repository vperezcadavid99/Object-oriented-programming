**1. Differential equations** 

As an application of the Runge-Kutta algorithm, the problem of a nonlinear pendulum is considered. For a pendulum of constant length l, the equation of motion for the angular displacement u with respect to the vertical passing through the suspension point is a second-order nonlinear ODE

**2. Particle in magnetic field**

Differential equation methods are employed to solve the equations of motion, describing the particle's trajectory in a magnetic field.

**3. Ballistic pendulum**

The problem of a ballistic pendulum is analyzed by determining its trajectory after impacting the bullet.
